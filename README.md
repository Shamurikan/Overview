I'm currently a front-end developer and want to become a back-end developer too, I usually program using markup languages ‚Äã‚Äãand `JavaScript` - which I'm still learning - and I don't use any frameworks yet, i ambitions that i want to be Full-Stack developer and Applications developer and Games developer and also UI/UX Designer.

I use [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to learn programming, about me this is the best website, and there is [Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/) and also about me this is the best website provides you with software learning tracks.
